# DSA

A collection of essential Data Structures and Algorithms with clear explanations and code examples. Ideal for interview preparation, competitive programming, and building a solid foundation in computer science.

## Whatâ€™s Included

- Implementations of common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.)
- Classic algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking, graph algorithms, etc.)
- Well-commented code samples for easy learning
- Practice problems and solutions for interviews and contests

## Who Should Use This Repository?
